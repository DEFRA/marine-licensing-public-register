 * import time rather than only after a per-file `beforeAll`.
 *
 * A single-member replica set (not a standalone server) so that
 * multi-document transactions work in tests, matching local Docker and all
 * deployed environments. The binary version is pinned to the mongo image
 * version in compose.yml.
